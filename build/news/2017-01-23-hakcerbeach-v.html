<p>While 2016 was a year of mostly maintenance work, 2017 has started off strong. Meeting up with several of the guys at <a href="https://5apps.com">5apps</a> for <a href="http://hackerbeach.org">Hackerbeach V</a>, we&#39;re working toward building an open-source Slack replacement using unhosted technologies Sockethub and <a href="http://remotestorage.io">remoteStorage</a>. No further details at this time, but we&#39;re close to an MVP. In the meantime, I released Sockethub v1.0.4 and activity should increase as we deploy Sockethub for multi-user use.</p>
