<p>Sockethub 4.0.0 has been released! This release has a few major updates to the underlying system, namely switching from <code>node-simple-xmpp</code> to <code>xmpp.js</code>, from <code>Kue</code> to <code>Bull</code> and upgrading to <code>socket.io v4</code>. Additionally, as we performed these significant overhauls of the code, we added more tests and optimizations. This release should be overall a lot faster.
