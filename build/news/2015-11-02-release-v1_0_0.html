<p>A branch which has been worked on for most of 2015 has been merged to the master branch and released as version 1.0.0. Currently only a couple platforms are fully ported over, but the plan is to continue to make incremental improvements. It&#39;s more stable and lightweight than the 0.x releases.</p>
