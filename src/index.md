Sockethub is a **protocol gateway for the web**, a translation layer that enables web applications to communicate with protocols and services traditionally inaccessible from in-browser JavaScript. 

By using **ActivityStreams** as a standardized message format, Sockethub acts as an intelligent proxy server that maintains state and connects to networks, sockets, and endpoints that would otherwise be restricted in browser environments. This approach gives applications and users greater autonomy, privacy, and protocol independence.
