A branch which has been worked on for most of 2015 has been merged to the master branch and released as version 1.0.0. Currently only a couple platforms are fully ported over, but the plan is to continue to make incremental improvements. It's more stable and lightweight than the 0.x releases.

[ [release v1.0.0](https://github.com/sockethub/sockethub/releases/tag/v1.0.0) | [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sockethub/sockethub/blob/v1.0.0/CHANGELOG.md) ]
