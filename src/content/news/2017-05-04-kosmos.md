Over the past several months, we've been quietly working away at an open-source group chat platform, build upon Sockethub and remoteStorage, and sprinkling of other tools and services. It aims to address the same area as Slack and HipChat, but built in the open, on open protocols (IRC & XMPP) allowing anyone to interface without needing to commit to a solitary platform. Today we met in Berlin and plan for a couple days of hacking and planning for our MVP target which should be coming soon.

I haven't been announcing every Sockethub release, as they are very frequent and incremental, but be sure to check the github to see the latest activity.
