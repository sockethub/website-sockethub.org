While 2016 was a year of mostly maintenance work, 2017 has started off strong. Meeting up with several of the guys at [5apps](https://5apps.com) for [Hackerbeach V](http://hackerbeach.org), we're working toward building an open-source Slack replacement using unhosted technologies Sockethub and [remoteStorage](http://remotestorage.io). No further details at this time, but we're close to an MVP. In the meantime, I released Sockethub v1.0.4 and activity should increase as we deploy Sockethub for multi-user use.
