Sockethub 3.2 has been released and includes a lot of improvements and work that has progressed throughout the year. The most notable improvement has come with the spawning of new threads for platform modules to help protect against possible platform crashes and memory leaks, which has greatly improved the stability of sockethub core. For a full list of changes, see [Sockethub release page](https://github.com/sockethub/sockethub/releases/tag/v3.2.0).
