Sockethub 4.0.0 has been released! This release has a few major updates to the underlying system, namely switching from `node-simple-xmpp` to `xmpp.js`, from `Kue` to `Bull` and upgrading to `socket.io v4`. Additionally, as we performed these significant overhauls of the code, we added more tests and optimizations. This release should be overall a lot faster. For a full list of changes, see the [Sockethub release page](https://github.com/sockethub/sockethub/releases/tag/v4.0.0).
